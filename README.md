# üß± Toy Blockchain in Rust

A simple educational blockchain implementation in Rust ‚Äî built from scratch with minimal dependencies. This project demonstrates key blockchain concepts like hashing, block structure, and proof-of-work consensus, all in ~100 lines of code.

## üöÄ Features

- **Block and Blockchain structs** - Core data structures for blockchain implementation
- **SHA-256 hashing** - Cryptographic hashing of block data using the `sha2` crate
- **Proof-of-Work mining** - Simple difficulty-based mining algorithm
- **Blockchain validity checking** - Verification of chain integrity
- **Genesis block creation** - Automatic creation of the first block
- **Simple CLI output** - Clear console output showing mining progress

## üì¶ Project Structure

```
toy_blockchain/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs      # Rust code implementing the blockchain
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml       # Rust dependencies (sha2 crate)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md        # You're here!
```

## üß† Concepts Covered

This project demonstrates several important blockchain and Rust concepts:

- **Structs and ownership in Rust** - Building data structures with proper memory management
- **SHA-256 hashing** - Using the `sha2` crate for cryptographic functions
- **Timestamps and nonce calculation** - Understanding block timing and mining mechanics
- **Mining loop (Proof of Work)** - Implementing the computational puzzle that secures the blockchain
- **Blockchain immutability and validation** - Ensuring data integrity through cryptographic linking

## üõ† How to Run

### 1. Prerequisites

First, install Rust if you haven't already:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env
```

### 2. Clone and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/toy_blockchain.git
cd toy_blockchain
cargo run
```

You'll see mined blocks and hash outputs in the console as the blockchain grows!

## üìã Example Output

```yaml
‚õèÔ∏è Mining block 0...
‚õèÔ∏è Mined block 0: 00d9b4c8a1f2e3d5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9
‚õèÔ∏è Mining block 1...

‚õèÔ∏è Mining block 2...

‚úÖ Blockchain is valid!

```

## üîß Configuration

You can modify the mining difficulty by changing the `DIFFICULTY` constant in `main.rs`. Higher values make mining slower but more secure:

```rust
const DIFFICULTY: usize = 2; // Number of leading zeros required
```

## üèóÔ∏è Code Architecture

The blockchain consists of three main components:

### Block Structure
```rust
struct Block {
    index: u32,
    timestamp: u64,
    data: String,
    previous_hash: String,
    nonce: u64,
    hash: String,
}
```

### Blockchain Structure
```rust
struct Blockchain {
    chain: Vec<Block>,
    difficulty: usize,
}
```

### Key Methods
- `new()` - Creates a new blockchain with genesis block
- `mine_block()` - Performs proof-of-work mining
- `add_block()` - Adds a new block to the chain
- `is_valid()` - Validates the entire blockchain

## üß™ Testing

Run the built-in tests to verify blockchain functionality:

```bash
cargo test
```

## üöß Limitations & Future Enhancements

This is an educational implementation with several simplifications:

### Current Limitations
- Single-threaded mining
- No network/peer-to-peer functionality
- No transaction validation
- Fixed mining difficulty
- No persistent storage

### Potential Enhancements
- [ ] Add transaction pool and UTXO model
- [ ] Implement adjustable difficulty algorithm
- [ ] Add network layer for distributed nodes
- [ ] Include digital signatures for transactions
- [ ] Add persistence with database storage
- [ ] Implement Merkle trees for efficient verification
- [ ] Add wallet functionality

## üí° Educational Value

This project is perfect for:

- **Rust beginners** wanting to build something practical
- **Blockchain enthusiasts** learning core concepts
- **Computer science students** studying distributed systems
- **Developers** exploring cryptocurrency fundamentals

The code is intentionally simple and well-commented to aid learning.
